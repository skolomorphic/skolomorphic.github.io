## Last Will

> If you are reading this, something has gone very wrong. 
> 
> I hope you will carry out my last will. Otherwise, a terrible calamity will fall upon Iyiria. I swear this on my name as a Duval. Hopefully, you understand what that means. 
> 
> First and most important, you must kill Luka Reviance within five years, no matter what. But if you can’t, stay far away from him and pray for the best. 
> 
> Second, I have attached certain fail-safes to my name. Therefore, please keep using the name of Acacius Duval as much as you can. Do not let it be forgotten. This way there is still a chance. 
> 
> Last, I hope you will look after my little sister. If you can’t escape the disaster, at the very least, help her escape this continent. And don’t let her inherit the Duval name. 
> 
> That is all.

## Unencoded journal entries 

**Age 10:**

> Cynara keeps asking why Mom doesn’t visit more. Hasn’t she figured out yet that we can’t rely on her? 
> 
> In this world, Cynara is the only family I’ll ever have.

> I finally got that thing. I gave Cynara the better part of it. She cried and said she didn’t want it, but I made her take it anyway. I think she was upset because of the state I came back home in. 
> 
> If she was so upset, that’s all the more reason she should have just taken it. 

> Cynara broke it. I got so angry I screamed at her. I almost died to get that thing, and now it’s all for nothing. 
> 
> She looked scared of me. I didn’t mean to do that. Maybe I should have told her what it was for… But it’s not like she would even understand, anyways. 
> 
> I don’t want things to happen the way I think they will. I need to make preparations again. 

**Age 11:**

> Preparations were useless. 
> 
> Cynara likes the Duval mansion. It’s like a fairytale dream for her. She got mad at me for being so suspicious of our new “home.” What the hell does she know?  
> 
> I can’t say anything here anymore. 

> Mom left just like I told Cynara she would. She won’t stop crying. Did she think we were important enough for her to stay for?
> 
> Idiot! 

**Age 13:**

> Cynara doesn’t understand anything, and I can’t tell her. 
> 
> I don’t think there’s anyone in the world I hate more than her.  

> I got a new title today. 
> 
> It’s definitely too late for me.

**Age 18:**

> Sometimes, I imagine Cynara finding out everything after my death. I imagine that she’ll finally understand why I did what I did, and that she’ll be sorry. And then she’ll open my journals to see what I said about her. To understand me better. I gave up on being understood by anyone long ago, but wouldn’t it have been nice? 
> 
> So Cynara, if you’re reading this…
> 
> You’re an idiot and a fool. It was over as soon as we were added to the Duval family record. You should have listened to me when you had the chance. Your favorite brother is dead because of you. That other bastard is dying because of you. And I’ll probably die because of you, too. 
> 
> If you feel sorry at all, then stop being such a damn crybaby. No one’s going to come save you, and you won’t have anyone to blame either. So pick up that sword of yours, point it where you never had the courage to, and do what has to be done. 
> 
> You’ll be miserable and sorry no matter what, so at least you should be free. 
> 
> But knowing you, you won’t be able to make the choice, will you? 
> 
> Then just live in your cage forever. 
> 
> If there’s such thing as a next life, I hope we never see each other again.
