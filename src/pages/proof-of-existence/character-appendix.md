**Acacius Duval:** The apparent heir to the Duval family. He seems to have had many plans in the works when he summoned Jeong Eunseok and lost everything to him. He has tan skin, rose-gold hair that is usually combed back, and sharp amber eyes. He is in a faction opposed to the three Great Families.

**Bakhta Burzinski:** The school librarian. No-nonsense, but never one to look down on one’s pursuit of knowledge, wherever they might be in their journey. She has dark skin and curly gray hair, and likes floral patterns. 

**Cynara Duval:** Acacius’ younger sister. Similar to Acacius, she has sharp amber eyes, but keeps her rosy locks in large twin braids. A self-proclaimed genius, and an early admit into the Academy. She has a bad relationship with Acacius for unknown reasons, and is in a faction opposed to the three Great Families.

**Cyprian Duval:** The Duke and patriarch of the Duval family. A powerful swordsman and commanding man with many sins under his name. He seems to be leading an underground criminal organization. Acacius and Cynara inherited their looks from him. 

**Dagian Naveen:** Acacius’ classmate. She has control over a destructive fire. She has long, wavy, dark purple hair, and wears a gold circlet and bangles. 

**Dalileh Khan:** The Practical Combat teacher and a veteran from the Rainy Wars. She uses water magic and enjoys adding aesthetic effects to her spells. A fashionable woman with dark hair, brown skin, and a wide smile. Students should address her as “Master Dalileh.” 

**Dreyminn:** Luka’s crow spirit friend. It has a silver sigil between its eyes and unknown capabilities. Acacius and his friend Zaire once kidnapped this crow spirit for unknown reasons. 

**Graves:** The Duval family butler and Cyprian’s right hand man. A dignified and elegant man with pale skin and salt-and-pepper hair. Though he is respectful and friendly to the members of the Duval family, he seems to have a disregard for other peoples’ lives. 

**Isul:** A priest who wears a hooded cloak and carries a dark lantern. He has dark skin and curly black hair worn in two-strand twists. A self-professed adherent of both the Signifier and the Secret-Keeper, he is friendly but mysterious, and more than a little suspicious. 

**Jeong Eunseok:** Our main character’s original name. 

**Luka Reviance:** Acacius’ classmate and enemy, whom the original Acacius insisted must be killed. Has black hair, slitted red eyes, and long gold earrings. He seems to have some unimaginable secrets hidden in his past. He intends to kill Acacius in two years.

**Raoul Sattari:** Acacius’ homeroom teacher. Brown skin, dark hair, brown eyes. Typically wears gold-rimmed glasses and a suit. Quiet and well-mannered, but nonetheless has a strong will. 

**Rhoswen:** Acacius’ classmate. A sleepy girl with unknown skills and long, auburn hair. 

**Sacha Reviance:** Luka’s teacher, and a powerful personage. A fair woman with long, pale hair, and prone to making people uncomfortable for her own amusement. Though they share the same last name, she is not related to Luka by blood. 

**Xander Morgan:** Acacius’ classmate. A proud and combative young man with dark blue hair and a sharp military style. His Morgan family seems to deal with military matters to the North. He is in a faction opposed to the three Great Families.

**Yugrazal Kamara:** An indifferent young woman with dark skin and braided hair tied back in a scarf. Co-president of the Fellowship of the Silver Wing and the prospective President of the Student Council. A member of the three Great Families. 

**Zaire:** Acacius’ friend. An outgoing boy with short hair, light brown skin, and freckles.
