Honesty is very simple: Nothing you say can technically be a lie. 

For our case, a lie refers to a factual statement that is, to your knowledge, untrue. 

In order to deceive others without lying, it’s necessary to lead people to their own conclusions. What should you keep in mind to make sure that what you say is still only the truth? 

## Asking Questions

Unquestionably one of the most useful tools in your arsenal. If you can’t avoid answering someone’s inquiry, try asking a question instead. 

Beginners can start off with easy questions like these: 

- “What do you think?” 
- “What do you mean?”
- “Why are you asking me? Can’t you think for yourself?” 
- “Shouldn’t it be obvious?” 
- “Are you an idiot?” 

These questions are often effective when paired with a scoff, a raised eyebrow, or a contemptuous expression that implies the other party should stop bothering you and figure it out themselves. 

When these tactics are too transparent, you can simply turn a statement into a question, like so: 

- “Things are like this, aren’t they?” 
- “Isn’t it the case that things are like that?” 
- “Don’t you think that things are like this or that?” 
- “It would be strange if things were like this, wouldn’t it?” 
- “How could things possibly be like this or that?” 

After all, if it’s a question, then it’s not a statement, and if it’s not a statement, it’s not a lie. 

## Avoiding Phrases

A phrase, even if it lacks a subject or verb, can be considered a lie. Consider the following example: 

> “What is your name?” 
> 
> “Acacius Duval.” 

Since the phrase “Acacius Duval” is being used as a direct answer to a question, it is a lie. In order to get around this, consider using a full sentence to answer the question instead, as follows: 

> “What is your name?” 
> 
> “Call me Acacius Duval.” 

Now, if someone assumes that to be your real name, that’s an unspoken implication that they’ve filled in on their own. It’s definitely not your fault.

## Distinguishing “Can” and “Will” 

Be very careful about saying that you “will” do something, because if you don’t follow through, you’ll be a liar. 

Instead, try saying “I can.” 

For example, instead of saying, “I’ll take care of the trash,” say, “I can take care of the trash.” 

That way, if you get into a freak accident that prevents you from taking out the trash, at least, you won’t have broken your word. 

Only use the phrase “I will” if you are absolutely certain that you can and that you will! 

## Paying attention to “Should” and “Must” 

“Should” is a flexible word. Whether it’s something you “should” do according to society, or according to your own best interests, or by some other arbitrary standard, as long as you don’t specify which standard you are using, it’s a pretty safe word to use. Just pay attention and only use it when there is some kind of expectation. 

To avoid lying, you should also be careful of the word “must.” There are very few things people “must” do. Eating, drinking, sleeping, and breathing are things you can safely say you have to do, but beyond that, things start getting fuzzy. 

You can safely use the phrases “must” and “have to” by naming specific conditions, such as saying, “In order to achieve this end result, I have to do this action.” Simply saying “I have to do this action” alone is most likely a lie!

## Using Similes, Metaphors, and Expressions

Commonly understood metaphors are allowed, such as “looking forward” to an event or saying you “can’t wait” for something. Although not literally true, these turns of phrase can be used as long as the usage matches with common intent and vernacular. Similarly, common expressions and sayings can also be used.

A good simile is a great tool in your arsenal. Saying “This is like another thing I thought of” is a great way of implying things that you can’t confidently state as truth. Just make sure that you actually believe the metaphor you’re using. 

## Using Qualifiers 

It’s only lying if you purposefully give a false statement. However, if you aren’t sure if something is true or false, play it safe and add a qualifier. 

For example: 
- “I guess…” 
- “It seems…” 
- “I can try to…” 
- “Probably…” 

Although you aren't a liar for accidentally believing something untrue, it’s safest to indicate somehow when you aren’t sure how true something is! 

## Forms of Address

Don’t call someone something you don’t consider them to be. 

For example, while saying “sir” or “ma’am” might be fine, it’s an absolute no-no to call someone “Teacher” or “sister” unless you actually consider them your teacher or sister. And if you consider them your teacher or sister, then you have to act like it. 

## Omitting Key Details

Context is key, and selectively removing context is a great way to give people a misleading impression about something that happened. 

## Acting Sarcastic

It’s amazing how much you can get away with passing off as a lie, as long as you roll your eyes, speak in a drawl, smile mockingly, and so on. Never underestimate the impact of tone and body language on how sincere the other person thinks you’re being. 

## Let People Make Their Own Assumptions

You’d be surprised how many details people can fill in on their own! If you notice someone forming an explanation for what happened, feed them just enough to confirm what they think. Remember, don’t try too hard to affirm their assumptions; people are best convinced of their assumptions if they think they discovered the truth on their own. 

## Never, Ever Tell Anyone You Won’t Lie 

As soon as someone knows that you adhere by this principle, every tactic on this guide will become extremely transparent. They’ll be able to spot you avoiding the question from miles away. But as long as they don’t know your underlying principle of behavior, you can get away with just seeming extremely annoying. 

For someone who doesn’t lie, the fact that you don’t lie is your first and most important secret!
