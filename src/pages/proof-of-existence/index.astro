    <blockquote><i>In my dreams, everything was burning. A voice was calling out for me.</i></blockquote>

    <p>Summoned forth as the intended sacrifice of a mysterious ritual, a young man finds himself in a new world with the face of his attempted killer, Acacius Duval, as well as a looming death curse if he doesn’t carry out Acacius’ last will. However, while Acacius has left many looming problems, he didn’t leave behind the most important piece: his memories. </p>

    <p>That would have been too convenient for navigating a world stitched together from apocalypses. </p>

    <p>Fortunately, after only a few life and death trials, Acacius’ unintentional replacement is sent away to the prestigious Nithemoore Academy, where he can learn everything he needs to know about the world and gain the power to grasp his freedom…</p>

    <p>At least, if the tracks of history don’t doom him first.</p>
