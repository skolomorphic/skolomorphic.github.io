## Titles

### [Acacius Duval] 

> **Symbol:** Acacia flower
> 
> **Description:** The heir of Cyprian Duval will surely be called by this name. 

### [Caller of What Must Be True]

> **Symbol:** Black knife
> 
> **Description:** Acacius Duval’s former World Proof. The power of a calculating mind that constantly evaluates others and describes others truly, even if it seems untrue. That which is hidden, or that which has not yet become true, shall surely be brought into the light. 
> 
> **Title Skill:** The title bearer can forcibly bestow whoever the knife cuts with a title borrowed from the future. The more powerful the title and the farther the future, the more vitality the title bearer must sacrifice in return. 
> - If the target does not fulfill the requirements of the borrowed title through natural means by the time the future becomes the present, they will die. 

### [Executor of the Sacrifice’s Last Will]

> **Symbol:** Golden chain

> 
> **Passive Effect:** You have an affinity for certain voices of the dead.

### [Bound Prophet of the Single Path]

> **Symbol:** Seamlessly knotted rope with no ends
> 
> **Description:** The dreamer of another future fears making great changes, lest the future slip out of control. Go forth and walk step by step to the end; dream as many variations as you like, for the destination you have envisioned will not change. But surely the small changes you accumulate will be enough to divert the path at the most critical moment. 
> 
> **Title Skill:** When the user sleeps, they can dream of the future, from now until a chosen future point in time. Until they reach the end date of the future that they have seen, they will not be able to dream of a different end. 
>
