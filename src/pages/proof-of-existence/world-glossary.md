## Political Entities
**Fulsgate:** A large city, autonomous zone, and trading center on the isthmus that connects Iyiria to the rest of the continent. It lies outside the Great Dragon’s protective border, so Iyiria and the Lemirian Empire both fight to influence it. The current compromise is that the international research organization, the Broken Kaleidoscope, currently runs the city.

**Iyiria:** The country where Acacius Duval resides. It is located at the eastern end of the continent, and is connected to the mainland by a thin isthmus. A constitutional monarchy that has been missing its head for over a century, with deep ties to the Great Dragon that once descended upon the country and saved it. 

**Lemirian Empire:** The Empire that rules the mainland continent and has its eyes on Fulsgate and Iyiria. 

**Nithemoore Academy:** Something between a vocational school and a college. With high standards and excellent teachers, it trains the next generation of Iyiria’s talents and elites. 

**Saivanad Empire:** Not much is known about this Empire. Raoul Sattari has made use of its rituals and skies. 

## About the Tripartite

The Tripartite are the three gods who oversee the world of Kosmonymia. Although using their power can grant great strength, it seems unwise to walk too close to the divine.

### The Scribe

`[I am the circle of history and the one who breaks it.]`

Rules over “history.” Their authority includes the granting and manipulation of titles. 

Their symbols include the serpent that devours its tail and the knife that cuts it. 

### The Signifier

`[I am the mask and the one who wears it.]`

Rules over signs, appearances, and “meaning.” The Great Dragon, who rules over sorrow, is a hierarch under the Signifier. 

Their symbols include the mask and the bow and arrow. 

### The Secret-Keeper

`[I am the mystery and the one who reveals it.]`

Rules over knowledge and mystery.  

Their symbols include the door, the key, the seamless knot, and the dark lantern.

### Hierarchs
These entities govern certain domains under the member of the Tripartite that they serve. One such example is the Great Dragon, who is a Hierarch of meaning and governs sorrow. Not much is yet known about the other hierarchs.
