## Political Entities
**Fulsgate:** A large city, autonomous zone, and trading center on the isthmus that connects Iyiria to the rest of the continent. It lies outside the Great Dragon’s protective border, so Iyiria and the Lemirian Empire both fight to influence it. The current compromise is that the international research organization, the Broken Kaleidoscope, currently runs the city.

**Iyiria:** The country where Acacius Duval resides. It is located at the eastern end of the continent, and is connected to the mainland by a thin isthmus. A constitutional monarchy that has been missing its head for over a century, with deep ties to the Great Dragon that once descended upon the country and saved it. 

**Lemirian Empire:** The Empire that rules the mainland continent and has its eyes on Fulsgate and Iyiria. 

**Nithemoore Academy:** Something between a vocational school and a college. With high standards and excellent teachers, it trains the next generation of Iyiria’s talents and elites. 

**Saivanad Empire:** Not much is known about this Empire. Raoul Sattari has made use of its rituals and skies. 

## About the Tripartite

The Tripartite are the three gods who oversee the world of Kosmonymia. Although using their power can grant great strength, it seems unwise to walk too close to the divine.

An individual member of the Tripartite is referred to as a Triarch. Each Triarch has created entities known as Hierarchs, akin to angels or demigods, that rule over part of their domain. 

### The Scribe

`[I am the circle of history and the one who breaks it.]`

Rules over “history.” Their authority includes the granting and manipulation of titles. 

Their symbols include the serpent that devours its tail and the knife that cuts it. 

#### The Scribe's Hierarchs

The Scribe's Hierarchs are chimeras that usually exhibit both dragon and phoenix traits. Each chimera rules over a portion of Kosmonymia’s recorded history.

At least one chimera is using its authority to ensure the complete eradication of a certain frame from history. Should any record of this frame enter someone’s awareness, the chimera will appear to destroy its traces. 

It is currently unknown how many Hierarchs of the Scribe exist. 

### The Signifier

`[I am the mask and the one who wears it.]`

Rules over signs, appearances, and “meaning.” 

Their symbols include the mask and the bow and arrow. 

#### The Signifier's Hierarchs

The Signifier's Hierarchs are dragons, and they each rule over one emotion. There are currently seven in the world, ruling over joy, desire, fear, sorrow, rage, ego, and repulsion. 

Dragons can control someone’s cognition to affect how strongly an emotion is attached to certain ideas. For example, the Dragon of Fear once cursed a nearby kingdom’s ruler so he became deathly afraid of the concept of “taking things into his body.” First he stopped eating, and then he stopped drinking, but before he could die of starvation or thirst, he decided to stop breathing and suffocated himself to death first. 

### The Secret-Keeper

`[I am the mystery and the one who reveals it.]`

Rules over knowledge and mystery.  

Their symbols include the door, the key, the seamless knot, and the dark lantern.

#### The Secret-Keeper's Hierarchs 

The Secret-Keeper's Hierarchs are the Phoenix of Observation, the Phoenix of Reason, and the Phoenix of Mystery. 

Because they affect aspects of knowledge, they are difficult to spot and track. The Phoenix of Observation, for instance, can control any sense that directly gathers information from the outside world. 

If the phoenixes don’t want to be perceived, they won’t be, but they occasionally interfere with the world’s affairs on a whim.
