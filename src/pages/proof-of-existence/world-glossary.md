## Political Entities
**Fulsgate:** A large city, autonomous zone, and trading center on the isthmus that connects Iyiria to the rest of the continent. It lies outside the Great Dragon’s protective border, so Iyiria and the Lemirian Empire both fight to influence it. The current compromise is that the international research organization, the Broken Kaleidoscope, currently runs the city.

**Iyiria:** The country where Acacius Duval resides. It is located at the eastern end of the continent, and is connected to the mainland by a thin isthmus. A constitutional monarchy that has been missing its head for over a century, with deep ties to the Great Dragon that once descended upon the country and saved it. 

**Lemirian Empire:** The Empire that rules the mainland continent and has its eyes on Fulsgate and Iyiria. 

**Nithemoore Academy:** Something between a vocational school and a college. With high standards and excellent teachers, it trains the next generation of Iyiria’s talents and elites. 

**Saivanad Empire:** Not much is known about this Empire. Raoul Sattari has made use of its rituals and skies.
